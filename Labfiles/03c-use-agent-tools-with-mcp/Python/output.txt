 ASSISTANT: You can use Azure CLI to create an Azure Container App with a managed identity (either system-assigned or user-assigned). Below are the relevant commands and workflow:

 ---

 ### **1. Create a Resource Group**
 '''azurecli
 az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
 '''
    

    

 By following these steps, you can deploy an Azure Container App with either system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities to integrate seamlessly with other Azure services.
